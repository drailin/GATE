             GATE examples
========================================

* GateModule
------------------------

Template library for analysis of GATE DSTs. 
Contains only a "dummy" algorithm (GateAlgo) using centellat tools.
A GataAlgo instance can be executed via root CINT macro (mac/runAlgo.C)
or via the executable RunGateAlfo.cc (to be created in bin/ with a "make bin"
command).
